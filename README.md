Market Inventory System
Technologies Used:
Frontend: Java Swing (GUI)
Backend: Java AWT (Event Handling), JDBC (Database Connectivity)
Database: MySQL
Project Overview:
The Market Inventory System is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage a small retail store’s inventory, sales, and profit tracking. The system provides user-friendly interfaces for both customers and admins, enabling efficient stock management, billing, and reporting.
Key Features:
1. User Module
Customers can view available products (vegetables and fruits).
Users can select items and add them to their cart.
The system generates a bill based on the selected items.
2. Admin Module
Admins can add, update, or delete products from the inventory.
The system tracks daily and monthly profits based on sales data.
Admins can view inventory stock levels and restock items as needed.
3. Billing System
Customers receive a bill summary with product details and total cost.
The bill is stored in the database for record-keeping.
4. Database Management (JDBC + MySQL)
Uses JDBC to connect Java with MySQL for data storage and retrieval.
Stores customer orders, inventory details, and sales reports.
Tools & Libraries Used
Java AWT & Swing – For designing the graphical user interface (GUI).
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) – To connect and interact with MySQL.
MySQL Database – To store and manage inventory data.
How It Works:
Login Page: Admins and customers log in.
Product Selection: Customers choose items from a categorized list.
Billing & Checkout: The system calculates the total cost and generates a bill.
Inventory Management: Admins update stock and track sales data.
Future Enhancements
User Authentication: Implement login authentication for better security.
Graphical Reports: Add charts for sales analytics.
Discount & Offers Module: Introduce discounts and promotional offers.
This project is great for learning desktop GUI development, event handling, and database integration in Java. Let me know if you need help with the implementation
